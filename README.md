Assignment 14

I used the D3 library to create an iteractive page with data from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.  

I also used to plot and style the charts:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js

Table shows metadata values.  Bar and scatter charts show samples data.  When a sample id is selected, the table and charts update to reflect the data of the selected item.

I worked with two classmates during study sessions and referenced their work in progress to create my final code:  Nick Nath and Amanpreet Kaur.  I thank them for collaborating with me.
